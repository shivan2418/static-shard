# ADR-0007 — Runtime failure contract: chunk-fetch errors & partial-failure semantics

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-21
**Ticket:** [T8 — Chunk-fetch error & partial-failure semantics (#11)](https://github.com/shivan2418/static-shard/issues/11)
**Depends on:** [ADR-0003 — Index & manifest (#7)](https://github.com/shivan2418/static-shard/blob/master/docs/adr/0003-index-and-manifest-design.md), [ADR-0004 — Codegen & typed client (#8)](https://github.com/shivan2418/static-shard/blob/master/docs/adr/0004-codegen-and-typed-client.md), [ADR-0005 — Package & CLI contract (#9)](https://github.com/shivan2418/static-shard/blob/master/docs/adr/0005-package-and-cli-contract.md)
**Refines:** ADR-0004 (folds `maxResults` throwing into a unified error surface), ADR-0005 (`formatVersion`-mismatch throw becomes a `ShardError` code)

## Context

The runtime (ADR-0004) is a zero-dep, no-WASM client: `connect({ basePath, maxResults? })`, an injectable `fetch`, a whole `manifest.json` plus lazily-fetched content-hashed index chunks and NDJSON shards (ADR-0003). A single `findMany` fans out to many parallel fetches. T8 fixes the **failure contract** those fetches obey — a runtime-level decision that was correctly held in the map's fog until ADR-0004 fixed the runtime shape.

Three fail-loud precedents already bound this decision: T1's no-silent-truncation ethos, ADR-0004's `maxResults` **throwing** rather than truncating, and ADR-0005's `connect()` **failing loud** on a `formatVersion` major mismatch. T8's job was to make the fetch-failure contract coherent with all three, not to invent a new posture.

This was a `/grilling` ticket. The decision tree below was walked one branch at a time.

## Decision

### 1. Philosophy — hard-fail, always

Any single failed fetch **aborts the whole query and throws**. A `findMany` returns a complete, correct result set or it throws — it never returns a silently-incomplete array. A partial result set is indistinguishable to the caller from a smaller-but-correct one, which is exactly the silent-truncation failure mode the project has repeatedly rejected. *Partial-with-signal* (returning gathered records plus an `incomplete` flag) was rejected: it splits the return type and invites callers to ignore the signal. A caller who genuinely wants best-effort degradation catches the hard error and degrades themselves.

### 2. No built-in retry, backoff, or timeout

The runtime does **zero** retrying. A failed fetch fails the query immediately (§1). Retry, backoff, timeouts, auth headers, and circuit-breaking all belong to the **injected `fetch`** (ADR-0004) or the CDN in front of the static files. Rationale: keeps the zero-dep runtime tiny; retry policy is genuinely host- and app-specific; and the injected-`fetch` seam is the documented extension point for it. The deploy-guidance doc ships a "wrap `fetch` to add retry" snippet.

### 3. What counts as a fetch failure

The injected `fetch` follows the WHATWG contract: it **rejects** on network-level failure (DNS, dropped connection, CORS block, timeout) but **resolves** on any HTTP status, including 404 and 500. The runtime therefore treats a fetch as failed when the promise **rejects** *or* resolves with **`!response.ok`** (status outside 200–299). Trusting `fetch` to have thrown was rejected — it would `JSON.parse` a 404 error page and crash confusingly downstream instead of raising a clear error.

### 4. Error surface — one `ShardError` with a discriminated `code`

A single exported class `ShardError extends Error` carries a `readonly code` drawn from a string-literal union. Callers do `catch (e) { if (e instanceof ShardError && e.code === '…') … }` — one import, one `instanceof`, an exhaustive `switch` on `.code` with type narrowing. Chosen over a subclass hierarchy: same narrowing, far less exported surface, and no `instanceof`-across-bundlers fragility. Adding a code later is non-breaking.

### 5. The `code` taxonomy

Every failure maps to exactly one code — as fine-grained as the caller's *reaction* differs, no finer:

| `code` | Trigger | Retryable? |
|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG` | `manifest.json` itself 404s / unreachable — wrong `basePath` | no |
| `FORMAT_VERSION` | manifest major ≠ runtime major (ADR-0005) | no |
| `DEPLOY_INTEGRITY` | a manifest-*referenced* content-hashed shard/chunk/sidecar 404s / is missing | no |
| `NETWORK` | `fetch` rejected, **or** resolved non-ok non-404 (500/403/429/…); optional `.status` | maybe |
| `CORRUPT_DATA` | fetch resolved 2xx but the body won't parse / decompress (bad JSON·NDJSON·encoding) | no |
| `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | the `maxResults` ceiling (ADR-0004) | no |

Judgment calls:
- **`HTTP` and `NETWORK` merged.** An earlier draft split resolved-non-ok (`HTTP`) from fetch-rejection (`NETWORK`). Merged into one `NETWORK` code carrying an optional `.status` (present when it came from a resolved response, absent on rejection). The retryability signal the split was meant to give is already delivered by keeping the deterministic codes (`CONFIG`/`FORMAT_VERSION`/`DEPLOY_INTEGRITY`/`CORRUPT_DATA`) distinct — `NETWORK` is the one "maybe transient" bucket.
- **`LIMIT_EXCEEDED` folded in.** ADR-0004's `maxResults` already throws; making it a `ShardError` code unifies the surface so a caller catches one type. It is deterministic and never retryable, sitting next to `FORMAT_VERSION`/`CORRUPT_DATA`.
- **`FORMAT_VERSION`** is ADR-0005's existing `connect()` mismatch check, now expressed as a code on the shared class.

### 6. The 404 routing rule

Because `NETWORK` absorbs generic HTTP errors, a **404 must not land in the retryable bucket** — it is never transient. 404 routes by **which file** was being fetched (always known at the call site):

- 404 / unreachable on **`manifest.json`** → **`CONFIG`** (wrong `basePath`).
- 404 on any **manifest-referenced content-hashed file** (shard, index chunk, zonemap sidecar) → **`DEPLOY_INTEGRITY`** (the manifest promised a file that isn't there — incomplete/corrupt deploy; re-run `build` & redeploy).
- Any **other** non-ok status on any file → **`NETWORK`** with `.status`.

This keeps `NETWORK` populated only by genuinely-maybe-transient failures, so a `fetch`-layer retry wrapper can key off the code sanely.

### 7. Concurrency — fail-fast + abort

On the first failure of any fan-out fetch, the runtime rejects the query and **cancels the outstanding parallel fetches** via a shared `AbortController` (standard, zero-dep) whose `signal` is passed to the injected `fetch`. First-failure-wins. *Settle-all-then-throw* was rejected: it wastes bandwidth finishing a doomed query. The cost is giving up an aggregate "here are all N missing shards" report — deemed an acceptable trade for 1.0. A custom `fetch` that ignores `signal` loses only the cancellation savings; correctness is unaffected.

### 8. Error payload

`ShardError` carries:

- `code` — the discriminant (§5).
- `message` — human-readable with remediation, matching ADR-0005's `FORMAT_VERSION` precedent (e.g. *"shard `abc123.ndjson` referenced by the manifest returned 404 — re-run `static-shard build` and redeploy"*).
- `cause` — the underlying thrown error via native ES2022 `Error.cause` (zero-dep), so the original `fetch` `TypeError` / parse error chains into stack traces.
- `url` — the file being fetched when it failed (absent for `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`). The single most useful debugging datum.
- `status?` — HTTP status; present on `NETWORK`-from-response and the two 404 codes.

The triggering **query object is deliberately not auto-attached** in 1.0: a `where` can hold user/PII-ish filter values that would then land in logs and error-reporting unexpectedly. `url` + `cause` suffice to debug. Query-in-error can be added as an opt-in later, non-breaking.

### 9. `fetch`-injection interactions (summary)

The injected `fetch` (ADR-0004) is the single seam for resilience and environment:
- It owns retry/backoff/timeout (§2) and receives the abort `signal` (§7).
- Its rejection ⇒ `NETWORK` (no `.status`); its resolved non-ok ⇒ `NETWORK`/`CONFIG`/`DEPLOY_INTEGRITY` per §3/§6.
- Tests and non-browser hosts supply their own `fetch`; the failure contract above is defined purely in terms of the WHATWG `fetch` behavior, so it holds identically for any conforming implementation.

## Consequences

- The runtime stays zero-dep and no-WASM; `AbortController` and `Error.cause` are the only platform features leaned on (both baseline in every target runtime).
- One catchable type (`ShardError`) with an exhaustive `code` switch — a small, documentable, type-narrowable surface consistent with the DX-forward posture of ADR-0004.
- Resilience is uniformly the injected `fetch`'s / CDN's job; the deploy-guidance doc (map fog) now owns the retry-wrapper snippet and the `DEPLOY_INTEGRITY` "corrupt deploy" story.
- **Refines ADR-0004 & ADR-0005:** `maxResults` and `formatVersion` throws are now `ShardError` codes rather than ad-hoc/independent throws — a surface unification, not a behavior change.

## Deferred to v2 (non-breaking)

- **Aggregate failure reporting** (settle-all to list every missing shard in one error) — §7 chose first-failure-wins.
- **Query context in the error payload** — §8; opt-in, additive.
- **Built-in retry/backoff** — §2; would be additive config on `connect()` if ever wanted.
